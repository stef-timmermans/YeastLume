This is the folder that the [data preprocessing notebook](../data_preprocessing.ipynb) utilizes for generating the paired image data for the model. The target files (which should be of `.tif` format), should be placed here.

All files in this directory, except for this README, are not tracked.

The [`example-data` directory](../example-data) can be used to run the [testing notebook](../test_single_frame.ipynb) to validate frame preprocessing (changes done there should be copied to the full loading notebook).
